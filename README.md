## Usage

```javascript
import callbacks from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/strided-base-mskunary-signature-callbacks@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### callbacks( table, signatures )

Assigns callbacks to masked unary interfaces according to type [promotion rules][@stdlib/ndarray/promotion-rules].

```javascript
import signatures from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/strided-base-mskunary-dtype-signatures@esm/index.mjs';
import identity from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-identity@esm/index.mjs';
import cidentity from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-cidentity@esm/index.mjs';
import cidentityf from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-cidentityf@esm/index.mjs';

var dtypes = [
    'float64',
    'float32',
    'int32',
    'uint8'
];

var sigs = signatures( dtypes, dtypes );
// returns [...]

var table = {
    'default': identity,
    'complex64': cidentityf,
    'complex128': cidentity
};

var list = callbacks( table, sigs );
// returns [...]
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **table**: callback table.
-   **signatures**: strided array containing masked unary interface signatures.

A callback `table` should have the following properties:

-   **default**: default callback.
-   **complex64**: callback for single-precision complex floating-point numbers.
-   **complex128**: callback for double-precision complex floating-point numbers.

## Notes

-   The function assumes that the provided signature array has the following properties:

    -   a strided array having a stride length of `3` (i.e., every `3` elements define a masked unary interface signature).
    -   for each signature (i.e., set of two consecutive non-overlapping strided array elements), the first element is the input data type, the second element is the mask data type, and the third element is the return data type.
    -   all signatures (excluding the mask data type) follow type [promotion rules][@stdlib/ndarray/promotion-rules].
